This project seeks to explore performance of decision trees, random trees, and bagging models built from scratch. 

The testlearners.py file is not my own, but was used to evaluate the code for my tree models.

Download all the python files and the yml file, and run tje testlearners.py to see the results. I included my writeup discussing these results
